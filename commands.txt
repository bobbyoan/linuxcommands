> - checks if one string is greater than another (lexicographically)
-n - checks if the string length is non-zero
-z - checks if the string length is zero

===End of String Comparison Operators===

-ne - checks if two numbers are not equal
-lt - checks if one number is less than another
-le - checks if one number is less than or equal than another
-gt - checks if one number is greater than another
-ge - checks if one number is greater than or equal than another

===End of Numeric Comparison Operators===

===File Comparison Operators===

===Logical Operators===

&& - logical AND
|| - logical OR
! - logical NOT

===End of Logical Operators===

You can combine multiple conditions using -a (AND) and -o (OR) within the same [ ... ] or [[ ... ]] blocks.
Use double square brackets [[ ... ]] for conditional expressions: It provides more features and fewer pitfalls compared to single square brackets [ ... ].
Quote variables: Always quote your variables to prevent word splitting and globbing issues.
Use spaces: Ensure spaces around the brackets and operators for correct parsing.
